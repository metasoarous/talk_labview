h1. Alkilinity Measurement Tool

This software is designed to operate an alkilinity measurement device consisting of

* Agilent 34970A Data Aquisition / Switch Unit
* Metrohm 876 Dosimat Plus Acid doser
* Relay Unit (controlling a stir plate and a mass flow controller - don't have the models on these at the moment of this writing. Sorry; maybe later)

This software was built for the University of Washington Friday Harbor Labs for an instrument 
setup consisting of the devices listed above. The software is provided here freely to any who 
may wish to construct a similar instrument using the same or sufficiently similar components 
(under the auspices that some modifications might have to be made on a per case basis). Should
someone wish to do so, it would be worth contacting me or the labs for more detailed information
on the actual equipment setup. At a later point, we may go so far as
to include some information in this repository regarding the actual physical setup of these 
instruments.
